        <h1>Sushi Roll</h1>
        <img src="../images/Sushi-roll.jpg">
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>All of these sushi rolls are sometimes referred to as “maki rolls,” which is any type of roll where ingredients like raw fish and vegetables are rolled with vinegar-seasoned rice and nori. The sky is the limit when it comes to filling ingredients, and the best part is getting creative with your own rolls.</p>
        <p>Or if you want to try something a little different, you can make Korean Kim Bap. It’s fairly similar to sushi, but no raw fish.<p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Seaweed</li>
            <Li>Rice</Li>
            <li>FIsh</li>
            <li>Cream Cheese (Optional)</li>
            <li>Avocado (optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
            <li>spread your sheet of nori with a layer of prepared sushi rice (that whole post covers how to make the rice), and flatten the top of the rice gently with a paddle, but do not smash the rice.</li>
            <li>Cut straight down through the filet, then cut that piece in half through the center so you have a small strip. Make sure you’re using a sharp knife and gliding with one stroke, to get a nice clean cut.</li>
            <li>Place your desired ingredients onto the sushi rice. I’ve got salmon, avocado, and cream cheese </li>
            <li>Roll it up tightly, using a bamboo ma.t</li>
            <li>Cut the sushi salmon roll into pieces</li>
        </ol>
